# SimplerS30

This is a firmware for the PocketGo S30 based on [SimpleS30](https://retrogamecorps.com/2021/02/13/introducing-simple30-an-optimized-pocketgo-s30-firmware/) by [retrogamecorps](https://retrogamecorps.com).

It addresses the following issues so far:

- Confusing file structure and random files all over
- The menu/power button didn't open the menu
- The on-screen notifications were unreadable
- 

The project also has additional goals:

- Periodically keep up with new emulator versions
- Switch to a more flexible launcher or perhaps a stock gmenu2x
- Port some non-libretro games
- Dump the internal flash and find out if modifications are possible
